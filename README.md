# ocr-detection
This project benchmarks state-of-the-art OCR models on healthcare documents and fine-tunes vision-language models (VLMs) to improve extraction and interpretation of clinical information. The goal is to build a reliable pipeline for accurate medical document understanding and downstream applications like record management and decision support.
